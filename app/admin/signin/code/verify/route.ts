 * Hand a typed code to the Auth.js callback — MIGRATION-PLAN §10.
 *
 * A thin shim rather than pointing the form straight at the callback, because
 * two things have to happen first: the code needs normalising (people paste
 * "483 920", and phone keyboards add trailing spaces), and the address usually
 * comes from the cookie set when the code was requested rather than from a
 * field the person fills in twice.
 *
 * Everything after that is the ordinary link flow. The token is the same token,
 * the callback is the same callback, and the lockout in auth.ts's wrapped
 * adapter counts these attempts exactly as it counts a mangled link.
