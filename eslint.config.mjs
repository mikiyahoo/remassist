       This is a file-level `off` and NOT an inline eslint-disable-next-line,
       deliberately. Under Node 20 (what the VPS runs) ESLint applies such a
       directive but still reports it as "Unused eslint-disable directive";
       under Node 24 (dev machines) it does not. `npm run lint` is
       --max-warnings=0 and the deploy gate runs the lint ON the server, so the
       inline form passed locally and failed every deploy — same bytes, same
       eslint 9.39.4, same eslint-config-next 15.5.24. A file-scoped rule state
       cannot be miscounted, so this form is identical on both runtimes. */
