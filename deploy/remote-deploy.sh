# aborts before the symlink swap, so the live site stayed on the previous
# release, which is the one thing that went right about it.
#
# The order this creates is worth being explicit about: the schema is changed
# while the OLD code is still serving. That is safe only because every
# migration here is additive — new tables, new nullable or defaulted columns —
# so code that predates them ignores them. A migration that drops or narrows
# anything would break the running release the moment it applied, and would
# need the change split into an expand step and a later contract step instead.
