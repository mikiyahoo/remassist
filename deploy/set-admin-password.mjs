 * Set the admin's password directly on the server.

 *   cd /srv/remassist/releases/$(ls -1 /srv/remassist/releases | sort -r | head -1)
 *   DATABASE_URL=$(sudo sed -n 's|^DATABASE_URL=||p' /srv/remassist/shared/.env | head -1) node set-admin-password.mjs
 *
 * Sorted by NAME, not by `ls -t`. Release directories are timestamp-named, so a
 * reverse name sort is the newest one. Modification time is not: the deploy
 * prunes node_modules from every release except the newest, and that `rm -rf`
 * updates the old directory's mtime — so `ls -t | head -1` returns the one
 * release guaranteed to have no node_modules, and this script dies on a missing
 * `pg`. It has done exactly that.
 *
 * Why this exists alongside tools/create-admin.mts: that script imports
 * lib/auth/password.ts, so it needs Node's type stripping (22.6+). The VPS runs
 * Node 20 — provision.sh specifies setup_22.x, but the box has drifted from it.
 * So the CLI the plan called "the recovery path" cannot run where recovery is
 * actually needed. This file imports nothing but node: builtins and pg, which
 * means Node 20 runs it.
 *
 * It also removes the step that went wrong: no hash is copied between machines,
 * so there is no placeholder for a paste to miss. The password is typed here,
 * with echo off, and never leaves this process except as a hash.
 *
 * The duplicated scrypt parameters below are safe to duplicate, and that is a
 * property of the format rather than luck: every hash stores its own N, r and p
 * (see verifyPassword in lib/auth/password.ts), so a hash written here verifies
 * there even if one side's cost parameters are raised later. What must NOT drift
 * is the string layout — scrypt$N$r$p$salt$hash, both halves base64.
