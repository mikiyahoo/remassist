/**
 * RemLoader — the brand animation that opens the home route.
 *
 * A port of the loader from `index.html` (`RemAssist-Html/assets/website-loader.js` plus its
 * overlay markup and inline failsafe), with three deliberate differences:
 *
 *  1. Canvas 2D instead of three.js — see `paint.ts` for why.
 *  2. Once per browser session, not once per page load.
 *  3. Compressed to ~1.33s and gated on readiness, rather than held for the
 *     reference's full 4.5s. MIGRATION-PLAN §7.4 originally cut this loader on
 *     the grounds that a splash in front of already-rendered HTML is a
 *     regression; that is right about the *masking* role it used to play, so
 *     what comes back is a short brand beat that gets out of the way, not a
 *     boot mask. The hold is derived from the sequence (FLOOR_MS in
 *     lib/loader/timeline.ts), so the mark is always seen to finish
 *     assembling — speeding it up is a matter of turning SPEED, and the hold
 *     follows on its own.
 *
 * The overlay markup is server-rendered into the static HTML of `/`. It has to
 * be — an overlay that arrives with hydration paints *after* the page it is
 * meant to cover, which is a flash rather than an opening.
 */

 * Module scope survives client-side navigation within the document, so once

 * Without this, a <Link> back to the home page would drop a full-screen
 * overlay into the middle of a visit.

/**
 * Runs during HTML parse, before first paint and before hydration.
 *
 * Three jobs the React bundle cannot do:
 *  - hide the overlay for a visitor who has already seen it this session,
 *    with no frame of navy in between;
 *  - hide it outright for a visitor who asked for reduced motion or is on a
 *    metered or 2G connection. They used to get the identical full-screen
 *    hold and scroll lock as everyone else, just with a static mark instead
 *    of the animation — all of the cost of the brand beat and none of it.
 *    Doing this in React instead would still paint a frame of navy first,
 *    because the overlay is server-rendered into the HTML on purpose;
 *  - guarantee the overlay clears even if that bundle never arrives.
 *
 * It hides rather than removes, on purpose: removing the node before (or
 * behind the back of) hydration makes React unmount a child that is no longer
 * there.

       does up to 1,680 synchronous getPointAtLength() calls against a
