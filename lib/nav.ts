/**
 * Navigation data.
 *
 * The desktop header renders its mega-menu markup by hand — each item carries
 * an icon, and the panels are pure CSS so the nav works with JavaScript off.
 * The mobile drawer cannot reuse that markup, so it reads the destinations from
 * here instead.
 *
 * lib/nav.test.ts asserts every href below is a route the app actually serves
 * and that the header still links it, so the two cannot drift apart silently.
