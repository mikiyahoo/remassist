/**
 * NOT COVERED, on purpose, and consistent with the note at the foot of

 * running the query — plus requireUser, requireRole and assertRole. Those need
 * a live session AND a live Postgres, and mocking the Drizzle chain would
 * assert that the mock was called, not that a disabled account loses access.
 *
 * They are covered by the phase 3 matrix in the plan, run in a browser against
 * a real database: signed out, manager, admin and disabled user against
 * /admin/leads, /admin/leads/export, /admin/settings, /admin/settings/team and
 * the setLeadStatus action. Move them here the moment CI has a DATABASE_URL.
