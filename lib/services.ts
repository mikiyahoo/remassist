/**
 * The service catalogue.
 *
 * It exists for `Service` structured data (§11.1): twelve pages each described
 * their own service in a `metadata` export that JSON-LD could not read, so the
 * one list here is what ServiceJsonLd renders from.
 *
 * It used to carry a second job — the cross-link band that closed every service
 * page — which is what `blurb` and `related` fed. That band is gone, and those
 * two fields went with it. What is left is only what the graph reads.
 *
 * `description` is copied verbatim from each page's own `metadata.description`
 * — the two must agree, because one is what a crawler reads in the <head> and
 * the other is what it reads in the graph.
 *
 * NOT the same list as SERVICE_LINKS in lib/nav.ts, which is the header's
 * ordering and deliberately omits GTM Teams and SDR as a Service from the
 * mega-panel. lib/services.test.ts asserts every path here is a route in
 * ROUTES.
