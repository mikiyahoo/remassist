 * Interview samples — the recorded clips shown on the top five service pages.

 * are the ones the files are named after. Poster frames are grabbed from each
 * clip (see `public/images/interviews`) so a card costs one optimised image
 * instead of a video download — the `<video>` element only mounts on click.
 *
 * The slug list has to stay in step with what is actually on disk: a slug with
 * no file gives every service page a card whose video 404s, and the count has
 * to stay at five or `interviewsFor` repeats a face (POSITIONS lists five seats
 * per service). `interviews.test.ts` asserts both against the filesystem.
 *
 * `position` is per service rather than per person: the card's top-left label is
 * the page's own role (the reference design puts the role where a logo would
 * sit), so the seat under the name has to read as a seat on that desk. Swap in
 * the real titles per clip here when the per-service recordings land.
