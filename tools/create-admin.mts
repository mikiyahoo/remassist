/**
 * Create the one admin account — MIGRATION-PLAN §10.
 *
 *   npm run admin:create
 *
 * Prompts for the password with echo disabled and accepts it in no other way:
 * not as an argument, not from an environment variable, not from a file. That
 * is deliberate. A password passed as an argument lands in shell history and in
 * the process list where every other user on the box can read it, and one
 * pasted into a chat window lands somewhere worse.
 *
 * The system holds exactly one admin — enforced by users_single_admin_idx in
 * migration 0004. This refuses to run when one already exists rather than
 * leaving the index to raise a less legible error.
 *
 * Talks to pg directly rather than through db/index.ts: that module does a
 * directory import of ./schema, which Next's bundler resolves and plain ESM
 * does not. A standalone script does not need the ORM to write one row.
